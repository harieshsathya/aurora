Aurora development has moved to the [Apache Incubator](https://aurora.incubator.apache.org).

If you had an old clone pointing to this URL you can do

    git remote set-url origin https://git-wip-us.apache.org/repos/asf/incubator-aurora

A [read-only GitHub mirror](https://github.com/apache/incubator-aurora) is also available.

Thanks for your interest!
